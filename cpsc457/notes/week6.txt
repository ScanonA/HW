in the write_file.c the reason that when you hit cntr+c the buffer for print isnt full so it doesnt write them down onto the output file 

SIGKILL and SIGSTOP cannot be handled or ignored 

ctrlc_write_file.c :

if you register SIGKILL to handle it in the code the code will still say killed becuase you can't handle it 

alarm.c :

void signal_handler(int signal);

q5 - 
	multithreading program do not forget to check the output 
	doesnt matter how fast your program is
	if the program output is wrong you will get 0
	carefull with the name of the files 
	be carefull with the loop legnth becuase the multiple may be so close to the actuall number that 	it could come up as prime
